            She said the most important skill you need to know to do her job is to be able to %2s around (a) %3s %4.
            She said it was easy for her to learn her job because she loved to %5s when she was my age--and that helps a lot!
            If you're considering her profession, I hope you can be near (a) %6s %7s. That's very important!
            If you get too distracted in that situation you won't be able to %8s next to (a) %s9!""" %(libs)
